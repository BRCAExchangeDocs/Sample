# BRCA Exchange Help Page Prototype

Welcome to the Help Page Prototype. Your feedback will help us create useful documentation of the [BRCA Exchange Website](www.brcaexchange.org). We want to ensure that our site's resources are accessible for Genetic Counselors, Clinicians, and eventually, patients. Please take a moment to view the website, and then visit this Help Page for tutorial and reference material.

**Items for Review:**

You are welcome to comment on any of the content in the prototype. However, we could use assistance in these specific areas:

* Do the "Expert Reviewed" and "All Public" Data Portal titles make sense to you? Do you have other recommendations for titles?
* Was the tutorial sufficient in guiding you through the search process? Were directions clear, concise, and complete? 
* Is there a term used on the Variant Details Page that you still do not understand, despite reviewing this Help Page? Which ones? Were any terms left out?
